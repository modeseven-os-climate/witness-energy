**Definition (extracted from [^1]):**
Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is the process of capturing waste carbon dioxide (CO2), transporting it to a storage site, and depositing it where it will not enter the atmosphere. Usually the CO2 is captured from large point sources, such as a cement factory or biomass power plant, and normally it is stored in an underground geological formation. The aim is to prevent the release of large quantities of CO2 into the atmosphere from heavy industry, and so help to limit climate change. Although CO2 has been injected into geological formations for several decades for various purposes, including enhanced oil recovery, the long-term storage of CO2 is a relatively new concept.

There exist several paths for storage:

* Depleted Oil & Gas 
* Enhanced Oil recovery
* Deep saline formation
* Deep ocean CO2 injection
* CO2 geologic mineralization through CO2 dilution in water
* Biomass burying and fossilization
* Pure carbon solid storage
