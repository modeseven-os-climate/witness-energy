# Steam Methane Reforming (SMR)


Hydrogen production using steam methane reforming (SMR) is a two-step process. The first step is to inject water vapor at very high temperature (700 to 1000 Celsius degrees) with methane in a pressurized environment (3 to 25 bars), which is the SMR process. The reaction generates hydrogen (H2) and carbon monoxide (CO) : 


$$CH_4 + H_20 (+heat) --> CO + 3H_2$$
