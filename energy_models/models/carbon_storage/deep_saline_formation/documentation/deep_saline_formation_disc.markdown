**Definition :**

Deep saline formation or deep saline aquifers exists all over the world and are a great potential for CO2 sequestration. They are located below 800m depth in general and CO2 can be injected in the deep saline formation for long term sequestration.

Within deep saline formation, the CO2 will be trapped in the structure first, then dissolved in water to be finally mineralized in the long term (over 1000 years). The mineralized CO2 is a stable long term storage option but direct mineralization option exists too. Equinor is proposing off-shore deep saline formation storage. [^1]

The cost varies 2$/tCO2 to 12$/tCO2 for on shore storage and between 6$ / tCO2 and 12$ / tCO2 for off-shore storage.[^2]
