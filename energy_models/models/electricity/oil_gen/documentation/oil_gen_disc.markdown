**Definition**

Oil-fired generating plants burn oil to produce electricity. They are similar in construction and operation 
to coal-fired and natural gas-fired facilities.[^2]

Heavy fuel oil was once a significant source of energy for electric power generation. 
After oil price increases of the 1970s, oil was displaced by coal and later natural gas. 
Distillate oil is still important as the fuel source for diesel engine power plants used especially in 
isolated communities not interconnected to a grid. Liquid fuels may also be used by gas turbine power plants, 
especially for peaking or emergency service. Of the three fossil fuel sources, oil has the advantages of easier 
transportation and handling than solid coal, and easier on-site storage than natural gas.[^1]
