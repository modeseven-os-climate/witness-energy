**Definition (extracted from [^1]):**
A coal-fired power station is a thermal power station which burns coal to generate electricity. Thermal energy produced by coal combustion converts boiler water to steam, which is then used to spin turbines that turn generators. Since about 38% of global electricity is generated from coal and produce every year over 10 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide, coal-fired power plant technology has been focused on two targets: 

Improve average efficiency from 38% to 48% by increasing pressure and temperature of the process (up to 650°C and 330 bar for advanced ultra-supercritical or retrofitted subcritical power plants) which allows a drop from 900 to 670 kg/MWh in CO2 emissions.

The usage of CCUS (Carbon Capture Use & Storage) by an integrated suite of technologies that has a proven 90% capture rate of carbon dioxyde produced.

## Data     

According to [^2] and based on 227 power stations, median water consumption is 2220 L/MWh.

Of the 2 080‑GW existing coal fleet, 62% is 20 YO or less, 16% over 40 YO, 22% from 20 to 40 YO. [^6]
