# Steam Methane Reforming (SMR)

Hydrogen production using steam methane reforming (SMR) is a two-step process. The first step is to inject water vapor at very high temperature ($$700-1000 C$$) with methane in a pressurized environment (3-25 bars), which is the SMR process. The reaction generates hydrogen (H2) and carbon monoxide (CO) : 

$$CH_4 + H_20 (+heat) --> CO + 3H_2$$


Carbon monoxide is a poisonous and deadly gas. A water-gas shift reaction is used to convert it to hydrogen and CO2 : 

$$ CO + H_20 --> CO_2 + H_2$$

The overall process is generating hydrogen and CO2 out of methane and water. The usage of biomethane allows to reduce the CO2 generation out of this process leading to close to zero-emissions hydrogen generation.
