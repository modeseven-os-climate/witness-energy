# Coal Extraction

**Definition:**

Coal extraction is the process to extract coal from natural ressources. After this extraction, coal can be used in different way.
The main process to extract coal is mining. As every industrial process, coal mining has energy demand and wastes, which lead to the cost of the coal. Moreover, as coal is a fossil ressource, the amount is limited.


**Price:**

To compute the cost of coal extraction, a certain amount of datas is needed.
Concerning the mining itself, the document [^1] gives informations about lifetime, production rate, Capex and Opex for 20 coal mines in Australia. From these data the following average are assumed :
Lifetime : 35 years, Capex : 0.00081 USD/kWh, Opex : 0.2*Capex
The exchange rate between AU.D and US.D is assumed as follow : 1AU.D = 0.77 US.D
Additional datas can be found in [^3].

**World production:**

Lignite, sub and other bituminous coal are used for electricity generation. China is the most important producer for coal with around 50% of the world production. Summed up, the world production in 2019 is 43752 Twh. [^2]

**CO2 impact:**

According to [^5], the full combustion of 1 short ton of coal emits 2.86 short tons of CO2.
