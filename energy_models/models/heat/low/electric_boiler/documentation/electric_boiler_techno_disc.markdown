# Electric Boiler

What is the electric boiler?

An Electric Boiler is a Boiler which operates using electricity rather than a combustible fossil fuel such as gas or oil boilers.
Electrically heated boilers make use of electric current running through a heating element to create heat, to boil water into high-temperature and high-pressure steam. They can be classified into the automatically controlled and the manually controlled types.

Low temperature heat in electric boiler technology, the temperature range is below 100 degree C.

In electricity demand, Electricity is used to produce 1kwh of heat (this information in kwh) : electricity_needs is in
kwh of electricity / kwh of heat

production in 2020 that is total heat produced by Electric boiler is 43 EJ = 11944 TWh

initial production for high heat temp = 11944/3 TWh

Working:

Electric heating is the process of converting electrical current into heat energy. The heating element within an electric heater is called an electrical resistor, and when an electric current passes through the resistor, this is where the heat is created.

An electric boiler is fed with cold water from the mains water supply.
Electricity is fed to the boiler from the mains electricity supply to the heating element within the boiler and they work essentially like giant kettles – using electricity and a metal element to heat the water.
The cold water is passed over the metal heating element and heat is transferred, resulting in hot water that can be supplied to the radiators and taps on-demand or from a hot water storage cylinder.
The exact way in which the boiler works in terms of heating and storing the water depends on the type of electric boiler/heater used.
