**Definition[^1] :**

Ethanolamine is commonly called monoethanolamine or MEA in order to be distinguished from diethanolamine (DEA) and triethanolamine (TEA). It is used as feedstock in the production of detergents, emulsifiers, polishes, pharmaceuticals, corrosion inhibitors, and chemical intermediates.

**Calculation :**

An average CO2 concentration in flue gases is calculated (Flue_gas_capture model) for the global energy mix, then the capture technology price is recalculated taking into account this variations.
