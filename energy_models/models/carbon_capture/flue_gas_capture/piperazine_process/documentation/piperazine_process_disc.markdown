**Definition[^1] :**

Due to the fast reaction rate of piperazine (PZ) with CO2, it has the potential to act as a promoter in aqueous ammonia (NH3)-based CO2 capture processes

Fundamentals of Piperazine process[^2]

**Calculation :**

An average CO2 concentration in flue gases is calculated (Flue_gas_capture model) for the global energy mix, then the capture technology price is recalculated taking into account this variations.
