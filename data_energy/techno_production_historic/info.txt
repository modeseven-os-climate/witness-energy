Antoine Perrot, 25 July 2024 : these production csv have been generated using the class variable "initial_production" which is at the beginning of the disciplline
class of each techno. At the same places in the code, some infos might exist on how the production have been computed, with sources when available.
At this time the year start default in witness is 2020.
We want to gather all these value in dataframe (years, production) and to complete the data later in order to change the year start easily.
